## How to Test Vulnerabilities

| Category | How to Test |
|:---|:---|
| Client-side control | Change `localStorage.role` to `admin` to see hidden buttons |
| Plaintext Passwords | Check MongoDB content, passwords are not encrypted |
| Brute Force Attack | Send massive login requests without block |
| Hardcoded Session ID | All users share the same session token |
| Directory Listing | Access http://localhost:3001/uploads to see files |
| Debug Mode | View server logs for sensitive information |
| No HTTPS | Capture network traffic to see sensitive data |
